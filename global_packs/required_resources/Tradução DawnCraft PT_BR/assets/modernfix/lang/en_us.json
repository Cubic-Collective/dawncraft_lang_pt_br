  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.async_jei": "1.16 only. **A key optimization.** Patches JEI to perform its reloading on a background thread, completely eliminating the long delay it adds to world loading.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.async_locator": "1.16 only. Backports the Async Locator mod's patches to eliminate server freezes associated with `/locate`, loot table generation, etc.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.biome_zoomer": "1.16 only. Minor optimization to improve the performance of the biome zoomer using logic from 1.18.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.blast_search_trees": "All versions. If REI or JEI are installed, construction of the vanilla search trees for creative searching is disabled, and searching is instead done using these mods' search implementations. This saves several seconds during world loading, and probably also saves some RAM as well (although I have not measured).",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.boost_worker_count": "1.16 only. Removes the hardcoded cap on worker thread count, similarly to what Mojang did in 1.18.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.cache_blockstate_cache_arrays": "All versions. Avoids creating fresh copies of enum arrays each time a blockstate cache is initialized. Minor optimization, but easy to do.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.cache_model_materials": "All versions. Memoizes the `RenderMaterial` (texture) collection and dependency list that models return instead of requiring them to be recalculated on each request. Helps accelerate the model load/bake process.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.cache_strongholds": "All versions. Saves the generated list of stronghold positions with the world, instead of regenerating it on every world load. Saves a little bit of time on 1.16, and quite a bit more on 1.18 and 1.19.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.cache_upgraded_structures": "All versions. Many mods ship outdated structure files, which requires the game to upgrade them using DFU every single time they are loaded. This can be quite slow. This patch adds logic to instead save the upgraded version of the structure, and reuse it on the next load. To handle the case that the mod changes a structure file but not the name, the original file's hash is compared against the cached version, and if they do not match the structure will be upgraded again.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.compress_biome_container": "1.16 only. Minor optimization borrowed from Hydrogen, which attempts to save space in the biome container when possible. This gets disabled automatically if conflicting mods like BetterEnd or Chocolate are installed.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.datapack_reload_exceptions": "All versions. Reduces log spam and possibly slightly improves loading speed by not printing the stacktraces for some commonly thrown exceptions during datapack reload (e.g. missing items in loot tables/recipes). The message is still printed.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.dedicated_reload_executor": "All versions. Moves resource pack and data pack reloading to a dedicated worker pool instead of using the default `Worker-Main` threads. This allows mods to Smooth Boot to still potentially improve singleplayer performance at runtime while not slowing down launch due to a limited thread count.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.deduplicate_location": "All versions, but disabled by default due to load time impact. Deduplicates resource location namespaces and paths. This saves RAM but also increases the cost of constructing a new `ResourceLocation` by quite a bit.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.dynamic_dfu": "All versions. Modifies DFU initialization to happen the first time something needs to be upgraded. This sounds similar to LazyDFU but is distinctly implemented, as it avoids loading *any* DFU classes/data structures, while LazyDFU only disables rule optimization. Essentially, this option is a safer version of DataFixerSlayer as it will still load DFU when needed.\n\nYou should typically continue to use LazyDFU even with this option enabled, as otherwise DFU rule optimization will cause lag.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.dynamic_resources": "All versions. See https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Dynamic-Resources-FAQ.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.dynamic_structure_manager": "All versions. Allows the game to unload structure files after generation concludes instead of keeping them loaded forever.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.fast_registry_validation": "All versions. Forge needlessly looks up a method via reflection every single time a registry is validated. This patch simply caches the returned value since it will be the same every time.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.faster_font_loading": "All versions. Optimizes the font renderer to load fonts faster, speeding up resource reload.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.faster_item_rendering": "All versions. Avoids rendering the sides of items in GUIs. (Yes, vanilla appears to do that.)\n\nThis can triple FPS with a mod like REI/JEI installed on weaker GPUs, if enough items are visible. Disabled by default since it's new and not tested much, but should be safe. The most likely issue is items being completely invisible in GUIs, or appearing flat in the world.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.faster_texture_loading": "All versions pre 1.19.4. Avoids reading textures twice (the first time using a very slow code path) and instead does one faster load (similar to 1.19.3+).",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.faster_texture_stitching": "All versions. Enables the game to use a faster texture stitching system originally written by SuperCoder79 for lwjgl3ify on 1.7.10, which can save some time during loading. Rarely, it's been reported to cause weird artifacts on blocks or in GUIs, this may be a Sodium bug.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.jeresources_startup": "1.16 only. Optimizes Just Enough Resources to not needlessly recreate villager entities many times for the same profession, which saves time during JEI startup.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.kubejs": "1.16 only. Optimizations to KubeJS to avoid needless `ItemStack` copying, etc., which reduces the time taken to load datapacks.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.model_optimizations": "All versions. Implements optimizations to speed up the model loading process.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.nbt_memory_usage": "All versions. Uses a more efficient backing map for compound NBT tags that deduplicates key names and also uses an array map for very small compounds. This reduces the overhead of storing many compound tags in memory.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.nuke_empty_chunk_sections": "1.16 only, inspired by Hydrogen. Avoids storing chunk sections that are full of air in memory, instead marking them as empty.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.reduce_blockstate_cache_rebuilds": "All versions. **A key optimization.** Newer Minecraft versions (after 1.12) implemented a blockstate cache system that caches frequently used information about a blockstate, such as whether it is solid, its collision shape, etc. Rebuilding this cache is quite fast in vanilla (it takes only a second or two) but is quite slow with many mods installed, as there are many more blockstates present in the game which all must have their caches rebuilt.\n\nThis problem is exacerbated by Forge as the cache is rebuilt at many points when the data would almost certainly be unused before the next rebuild. Examples include right before reaching the main menu (during the \"Freezing data\" stage), as well as multiple (!) times when a world is being loaded.\n\nModernFix solves this performance bottleneck by instead making cache rebuilds lazy. Each blockstate rebuilds its cache the first time the data would be accessed. At any point when vanilla or Forge would attempt to rebuild caches for all blockstates, this is redirected to simply invalidate the cache on each blockstate instead.\n\nThis should not have any impact on TPS after startup concludes.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.remove_biome_temperature_cache": "All versions. Removes the biome temperature cache as Lithium does on modern versions.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.resourcepacks": "All versions. **A key optimization.** Launches on modern versions are heavily bottlenecked by filesystem access. Many requests are frequently made to resource packs to list resources or check if a given resource exists, and each of these result in a very slow file API call.\n\nModernFix completely eliminates most of the bottleneck here by simply caching a listing of all resources that exist within mod-provided and vanilla resourcepacks. The cache is rebuilt on resource reload (except for the vanilla resources, since they should never change while the game is running).\n\nThere are no known compatibility issues with this patch except for OptiFine (its CTM resources do not load correctly). However I do not recommend using OptiFine in any scenario, as it adds several minutes to launch time by itself and is not tested with ModernFix at all.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.reuse_datapacks": "1.16 only. Attempts to speed up switching between singleplayer worlds by skipping the datapack reload when possible. May cause compatibility issues with some mods, but is currently enabled by default.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.rewrite_registry": "All versions. **Currently semi-broken.** Aggressively replaces some internals of the Forge registry system with faster versions, however it currently causes freezes when loading some modpacks. Off by default for obvious reasons.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.skip_first_datapack_reload": "1.16 & 1.19 only. **A key optimization.**\n\nIn the middle of the 1.16 development cycle, Forge patched the game to reload datapacks twice when loading an existing world, in order to fix an issue with biome ID shifting. Unfortunately, datapack reloads often take upwards of 30 seconds and so this very severely affects world loading times.\n\nModernFix makes the necessary changes to avoid this reload, based on the unfinished Forge PR #8163.\n\nThis change was removed by Forge in 1.18, but then a similar patch was added *again* in 1.19 to fix mod datapacks not being loaded when creating new singleplayer worlds. Fortunately, the issue is localized to the world creation screen in 1.19, and existing worlds only require a single reload. However, this still doubles the length of the lag spike when clicking \"Create New World\" in 1.19, and so ModernFix again makes changes to not perform a redundant reload.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.state_definition_construct": "All versions. Enabled only if FerriteCore is installed. Takes advantage of FerriteCore's handling of blockstates to speed up their creation. This can help speed up launch with mods that add lots of blockstates, such as furniture mods.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.sync_executor_sleep": "All versions. Avoids having the main thread spin idly consuming one CPU core while waiting for the modloading workers to finish.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.thread_priorities": "All versions. Adjusts the worker and server thread priorities to be lower than the client thread. This helps improve FPS stability on machines with few CPU cores, provided that the Java implementation in use respects priorities.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.perf.use_integrated_resources": "Mostly for 1.16. Patches JEResources to use the integrated server's loot table data if playing singleplayer, rather than pointlessly reloading loot tables. Saves a couple more seconds during JEI startup.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.bugfix.concurrency": "The patches in this group fix concurrency-related issues within Minecraft and/or Forge. Most of them result in rare, hard-to-diagnose crashes during loading.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.bugfix.edge_chunk_not_saved": "This option is a port of SuperCoder's Chunk Saving Fix mod (because I didn't realize it was already available for Forge at the time).",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.bugfix.mc218112": "This option fixes a deadlock that can occur if an exception is thrown while processing entity data. Vanilla does not correctly unlock the data manager when it should. This is tracked as MC-218112 on the bug tracker, and was fixed by Mojang in 1.17.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.bugfix.packet_leak": "**Experimental**, not enabled by default. An attempted fix for the memory leak issue that occurs after playing long enough on 1.16.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.bugfix.paper_chunk_patches": "1.18 and newer. **A key optimization.** Ports a patch from Paper that fixes issues on 1.17 with chunkloading requiring huge amounts of memory and generating many `CompletableFuture` instances. 1.18+ are now able to load worlds on only 400MB of memory like 1.16 could.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.bugfix.tf_cme_on_load": "Patches Twilight Forest to perform non-thread-safe client setup using the main thread as it should, rather than the FML worker thread.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.feature.branding": "Adds ModernFix to the branding list on the title screen, and also to the F3 screen.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.feature.direct_stack_trace": "Normally off, can be enabled to force the raw stack trace to be dumped to the log when a crash occurs. Occasionally vanilla's crash report system fails to work properly and gives an entirely irrelevant stack trace/report.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.feature.measure_time": "Uses a couple injections to measure world load time, datapack reload time, resource reload time, bootstrap time, and adds the necessary hooks to enable vanilla's unused profiler logic for resource reloading if so configured.",
  "modernfix.option.mixin.feature.spam_thread_dump": "**To be used for debugging purposes only.** Causes a thread dump to be output to the log every 60 seconds. This can help to diagnose unexplained freezes during loading/gameplay."
