Its orientation matches that of vanilla maps, so it can be a great tool for orienting yourself when searching for one of this modpack's many map locations such as bosses. "]

The Guild Master's hut is also where you can check your villager reputation (via the reputation book) and donate emerald bundles (via the donation box). More on reputation in the next section."

The player will need to sleep for the donation to take effect. Multiples may be needed to fully restore reputation. Reputation is lowered by looting chests or barrels in front of villagers or harming them. If your reputation is low, you cannot recieve quests or trades from villagers, or turn in existing quests."]

			description: ["One of the most important factors in your combat success is your diet. Monsters hit hard and fast, and your health is sure to take a beating. Eating meals with high saturation will ensure that your HP regen lasts longer, and this can make the difference between life and death. Golden foods can help even more in this regard, though at a high price. Additionally, the diversity of your diet will apply buffs which can help you survive. See the \"Cooking and Farming\" quest tab for meal options. The Food Book (craftable, and obtained from this quest) will show you your current and possible meal buffs."]

Do note that vanilla attacks deal half as much damage as you would in combat mode, simply because you're not committing to your attacks."]
