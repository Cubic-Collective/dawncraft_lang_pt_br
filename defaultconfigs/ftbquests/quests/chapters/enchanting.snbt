				"There are 3 new values which effect the quality of your enchantments - Eterna, Quanta and Arcana. The number of enchantment clues can also be affected. See below for descriptions of each."
				""
				"&b&lEterna"
				"Represents how strong your enchantment is, increasing the level cost. Only blocks surrounding the enchanting table one-block away and two-blocks high will affect enchantment values. Enchantment levels can reach up to 100 (rather than the vanilla 30), allowing for rarer and higher-level enchantments than usual."
				""
				"&b&lQuanta"
				"Affects the potential power and variance of the enchantmenr. High quanta can lead to large boosts in enchantment quality, however you also risk getting lower level enchantments or even curses if you are unlucky. \"Rectification\" can be added via certain blocks to reduce the potential negative effects of quanta, making it a purely beneficial stat. An amount of quanta is always good to have, even without rectification."
				""
				"&b&lArcana"
				"Increases the number of enchantments and makes rare enchantments more common."
